# Davies-Burgers

This project is a front-end restaurant website for Davie JR's, which includes multiple pages such as the Home, Menu, Nutrition, Order, and Locations. Each page has been designed with a cohesive theme and style, including responsive design features to ensure the website is accessible on various screen sizes.
The website is built with HTML and CSS, focusing on ease of navigation and a clean, minimalist aesthetic.

* This project started as a pre-built main page (index.html) and a basic css document to style the page. All the other pages were then added by me and the css improved and media queries also added by me.
